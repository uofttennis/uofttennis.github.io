				About the Club
			</h1>

			<p>
				This club was officially created during the Fall semester of 2011 after several students noticed a void where a tennis club should have been. The intention was to foster the growth of recreational tennis at the <strong>University of Toronto</strong>. Any student, faculty, or alumnus is encouraged to join. Feel free to shoot us an e-mail at uofttennisclub@gmail.com and join our Facebook page!
			</p>
			
			<p>We currently have a team of 11 Executives and a membership that runs 300 strong. We host weekly practice sessions, an Intramural league, and a few Tournaments throughout the year. We are always looking for new members to inspire and encourage others to reach their full potential. If you feel you are up to the task and would like to join our executive team, shoot us an e-mail with a short description of why you want to join, your experiences and a little bit about yourself. We normally recruit new Executives at the start of the Fall semester</p>
